## 1. Who collected the InsideAirbnb data?

::: {.duedate}

( 2 points; Answer due Week 7 )

Murray Cox is the founder and current chief data activist of Inside Airbnb. He conceived the project, compiled and analyzed the data, and built the site. A variety of collaborators and partners interested in InsideAirbnb also contributed to data updates and maintenance, for example Taylor Higgins, Michael "Ziggy" Mintz, and so on.

## 2. Why did they collect the InsideAirbnb data?

::: {.duedate}

( 4 points; Answer due Week 7 )

Because they aim to provide data and advocacy about Airbnb's impact on residential communities. And they work towards a vision where communities are empowered with data and information to understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists.

:::

```{python}
#| output: asis
print(f"One of way to embed output in the text looks like this: after cleaning, we were left with {df.shape[0]:,} rows of data.")
```

This way is also supposed to work (`{python} f"{df.shape[0]:,}" `) but I've found it less reliable.

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);
```

## 3. How did they collect it?

::: {.duedate}

( 5 points; Answer due Week 8 )
Inside Airbnb collects its data by scraping publicly available information from Airbnb's website. This process involves extracting details such as listing descriptions, host information, availability calendars, and user reviews. The collected data is then verified, cleansed, analyzed and aggregated.

## 4. How does the method of collection (Q3) impact the completeness and/or accuracy of the InsideAirbnb data? How well does it represent the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?

::: {.duedate}

( 11 points; Answer due Week 9 )

:::

InsideAirbnb collects data by scraping publicly available Airbnb listings, a method that can introduce certain limitations. For instance, inactive or off-platform listings may be missing, leading to incomplete coverage. Scraping errors and Airbnb’s deliberate data obfuscation, hiding exact locations or limiting transparency about occupancy, can also affect data accuracy. Additionally, because listings can be deactivated, modified, or newly added between scraping sessions, the dataset may become outdated over time.

While the data provides a useful snapshot of Airbnb’s activity, it does not fully capture the complexities of host and guest interactions. This raises concerns about representation bias, as hidden transactions remain unaccounted for. Privacy issues also emerge from using personal data without explicit consent. Furthermore, relying on incomplete data could result in misleading conclusions for urban planning and policy-making.


## 5. What ethical considerations does the use of the InsideAirbnb data raise? 

::: {.duedate}

( 18 points; Answer due {{< var assess.group-date >}} )
First, informed consent and privacy issues. Inside Airbnb is obtained by scraping data from the Airbnb website. The possible problem is that hosts and Airbnb users do not know that their data is being collected, which raises transparency and autonomy issues. At the same time, the scraped data includes property addresses, personal comments, etc., which may cause harassment or privacy violations.
Second, representative bias. Airbnb listings may be concentrated in administrative areas with better geographical (such as inner London) and socioeconomic conditions, while low-income communities and underrepresented communities with fewer Airbnb listings may be ignored or marginalized. At the same time, hosts on Airbnb do not represent the general population. They usually tend to be higher-income people and do not include workers living in public housing. Conclusions based solely on Airbnb data may ignore diverse housing needs. In addition, Airbnb's search algorithm may give priority to highly rated, high-priced, and more active listings, ignoring inactive or low-rent listings, resulting in the scraped data reflecting platform bias and exaggerating market activities.

## 6. With reference to the InsideAirbnb data (*i.e.* using numbers, figures, maps, and descriptive statistics), what does an analysis of Hosts and the types of properties that they list suggest about the nature of Airbnb lettings in London?

:::

## 7. Drawing on your previous answers, and supporting your response with evidence (*e.g.* figures, maps, EDA/ESDA, and simple statistical analysis/models drawing on experience from, e.g., CASA0007), how *could* the InsideAirbnb data set be used to inform the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London?

## Sustainable Authorship Tools

Using the Terminal in Docker, you compile the Quarto report using `quarto render <group_submission_file>.qmd`.

Your QMD file should automatically download your BibTeX and CLS files and any other required files. If this is done right after library loading then the entire report should output successfully.

Written in Markdown and generated from [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
